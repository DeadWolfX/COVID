csv annotations for RetinaNet where you have bounding boxes in the format [x1,y1,x2,y2] where (x1,y1) are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the box and (x2,y2) are the coordinates of the lower right corner , each csv indicates which set the annotations belong to (training, validation or testing)<br><br>

For images with opacities the bounding box encloses the opacity.<br>

Images without opacity do not have annotations.
