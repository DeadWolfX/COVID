Annotations are provided in CSV format for RetinaNet, including bounding boxes in the format<p>La ecuaci√≥n de la recta es: \( y = mx + b \)</p> \( [x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\] \) . Here, $\(x_1, y_1\)$ represents the coordinates of the upper left corner of the box, and $(x_2, y_2)$ represents the coordinates of the lower right corner. Each CSV file indicates which set the annotations belong to (training, validation, or testing).<br>

For images with opacities, the bounding box encloses the opacity region.<br>

Images without opacities have a bounding box that surrounds the entire image.
